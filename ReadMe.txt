NOTE - Hey Callan, just want to list a few stuff I noticed but didnt have time to fix or implement
	Overall I am a lot happier with this project and I actually started to enjoy making it
	(not going to lie, I have hated coding the last few months but seems like im getting 
	back to it so woohoo!)

Movement 	- Delay between key pressed and movement happening
	 	- Stop moving when a shot is fired
Collisions 	- seem to be a bit off
Lighting 	- Would have liked to use different lighting and fix rim lighting
Reflection 	- Would have like to have used reflection on the ground, however could not figure 
			out Reflection Maps so could not control the "strength" of the reflection 
			and decided to place the reflection on the bullets instead 
	   	- Would have liked to have objects shown in the reflection as well instead of 
			just the skybox
Models 		- Could load models fine but could not figure out how to manipulate them as 
			the shapes and objects i already create
		- Would have prefered to use them as the player and enemy models and wouldve gotten 
			one for the bullets as well
Menu		- Could look nicer
General Code	- Could have variables and functions etc all very uniform with naming and placement
			I have stuck to a consistent naming and placement convention for the most 
			part but yea could have been better.
		- Could figure out cleaner less messy code and smarter way of doing things for sure
